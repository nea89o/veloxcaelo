# Velox Caelo

> Basically just one patch to make your OptiFine a bit faster.

This mod needs **[OptiFine](https://optifine.net/downloads)** and Forge to do anything.

Put OptiFine and this mod ([download here](https://github.com/nea89o/veloxcaelo/releases)) to your mod folder.

This mod is will have the most impact with texture packs with a lot of custom item textures.
